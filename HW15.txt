Non-programming Assignment

1) What is SDLC and what are its steps?

2) List and describe different SDLC types.

ANSWER
=====================================================
1.) What is SDLC?
    SDLC stands for Software Development Life Cycle, a structured process used to plan, design, develop, and test software. 
    It ensures systematic and efficient software development. The steps in SDLC include:

    a. Planning: The organization’s total information system needs are identified, analyzed, prioritized, and organized.
    b. Analysis: System requirements are studied, defined, and structured.
    c. Design: The recommended solution is transformed into detailed specifications:
        - Logical Design: Describes the system’s functional features independently of any technology or platform.
        - Physical Design: Converts the logical specifications into technology-specific details needed for programming and system construction.
    d. Implementation: The system is coded, tested, installed, and deployed within the organization.
    e. Maintenance: The system is continuously repaired and improved to adapt to new requirements.
    f. Obsolescence: When the system becomes outdated, it is replaced with a new generation system.


2.) What are the Types of SDLC Models?
    Different SDLC models provide various approaches to software development:

    a. Waterfall Model: A linear, sequential approach where each phase must be completed before moving to the next.
    Simple and easy to understand but lacks flexibility, as changes cannot be made mid-project.
    b. Agile Model: An iterative and incremental approach that emphasizes flexibility and customer collaboration.
    Allows for mid-project changes and promotes continuous feedback throughout development.
    c. Rapid Application Development (RAD): Focuses on quick development using prototypes and iterative feedback.
    Prioritizes user involvement and rapid delivery of functional software.
    d. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a modular design approach where reusable services interact through standard protocols such as REST or SOAP. 
    This architecture promotes scalability, reusability, and seamless integration across systems, making it ideal for complex and distributed applications. 
    
    - eXtreme Programming (XP): A type of Agile method emphasizing frequent releases in short development cycles.
    Promotes high customer satisfaction through constant collaboration and adaptation.
     
    - CASE Tools: Computer-Aided Software Engineering tools support the development process by automating tasks like design and testing.
   
    By selecting the appropriate SDLC model, teams can align their development process with project requirements and constraints.
