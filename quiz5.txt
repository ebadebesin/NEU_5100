Questions:
What is an abstract class?

ANSWER
An abstract class serves as a foundation and blueprint for other subclasses, it is designed to be extended and not instantiated directly. 
It provides a shared structure and common functionality that multiple derived classes can inherit, which allows a clean and efficient way to organize code. 
Abstract classes help encapsulate the essential characteristics relevant to the programâ€™s operation, this helps with code reuse and consistency. 
By defining a common interface for subclasses, abstract classes allow you to outline partial or incomplete implementations that other classes can build upon and customize. 

Key things to note for Abstract Classes:

Inheritance: Subclasses inherit the properties and methods of the abstract class.
Code Reusability: Abstract classes promote code reusability by defining common behaviors and properties that can be shared across multiple subclasses.
Polymorphism: Abstract classes enable polymorphism, allowing objects of different subclasses to be treated as objects of the abstract class.
