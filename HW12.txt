1) How to read information from a file?
2) How to write information to a file?

ANSWER
==================================
1. Reading Information from a File
----------------------------------
You can read information from a file using the following methods:
1: Using Scanner
    Instantiate a File object specifying the path to the file.
    Create a Scanner object to read the file line by line.
    Use a while loop to check if there's a next line and read it using nextLine().
    After reading, close the scanner to release resources.

2: Using Buffered Reader
    Create a FileReader to read the file and a BufferedReader to read the file line by line efficiently.
    Use a while loop to read lines using readLine().
    Close the BufferedReader to release resources.

Always use try-catch blocks to handle potential errors like FileNotFoundException and IOException.

2. Writing Information to a file
--------------------------------
You can write information to a file using the following method:
1: Using FileWriter
    Create a FileWriter object specifying the file path and mode.
    Use the write() method to write characters to the file.
    Close the FileWriter to save the changes.

2: Using a BufferedWriter:
    Create a FileWriter and a BufferedWriter for efficient writing.
    Use the write() method to write characters or lines to the file.
    Close the BufferedWriter to save the changes.

Always use try-catch blocks to handle potential errors like FileNotFoundException and IOException.
