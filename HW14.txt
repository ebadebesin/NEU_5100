Non-programming Assignment

1) How can we add GUI to a Java program?

2) What is AWT - Abstract Windowing Toolkit?

3) What is Swing?

ANSWER
=====================================================
1.)
To add a Graphical User Interface (GUI) to a Java program, developers use libraries such as Swing or AWT (Abstract Windowing Toolkit). 
These libraries provide prebuilt classes and components like buttons, text fields, labels, and more, to create interactive interfaces. 
Developers can use these tools to design windows, menus, and dialogs. The GUI is event-driven, meaning user actions like clicks and inputs trigger specific responses in the program.

Example:

import javax.swing.*;
public class Sample {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        JFrame frame = new JFrame("Simple GUI"); // Create a frame
        JButton button = new JButton("Click Me"); // Add a button
        frame.add(button); // Add the button to the frame
        frame.setSize(300, 200); // Set frame size
        frame.setDefaultCloseOperation(JFrame.EXIT_ON_CLOSE); // Close on exit
        frame.setVisible(true); // Make the frame visible
    }
}


2.) 
AWT is Java's original toolkit for building graphical user interfaces (GUIs). 
It provides basic components like windows, buttons, text fields, and menus. 
AWT components are heavyweight, meaning they rely on the native GUI of the operating system to render components, which can cause inconsistencies in appearance across platforms. 
AWT doesn't follows MVC(Model View Controller) where model represents data, view represents presentation and controller acts as an interface between model and view.
AWT is considered less flexible compared to modern GUI libraries like Swing. The Swing classes are built on top of the AWT architecture


3.)
Swing is a lightweight GUI toolkit built on top of AWT. 
Unlike AWT, Swing components are platform-independent, ensuring a consistent appearance across different operating systems. 
Swing provides advanced components such as tables, lists, scrollpanes, colorchooser, tabbedpane etc., which are not available in AWT. 
It also supports a pluggable look and feel, allowing developers to customize the interface's appearance. Swing components are part of the javax.swing package.
Swing is more flexible and powerful than AWT, making it the preferred choice for building complex GUI.
