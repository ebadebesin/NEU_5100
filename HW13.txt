1) What is JDBC?
2) How to connect your Java program to a database?

ANSWER
------------------

1) JDBC stands for Java Database Connectivity. It is a Java API that allows Java programs to interact
with relational databases. JDBC provides a standard way for Java programs to access and manipulate
data in a database.

There are four types of JDBC driver:
JDBC-ODBC Bridge driver
Native driver
Network Protocol Driver
Thin driver

================================

2) To connect your Java program to a database, you need to follow these steps:
- Load the JDBC driver for the database you are using (e.g. MySQL, Oracle,
PostgreSQL, etc.)

- Create a connection to the database using the JDBC driver
- Execute SQL queries to perform operations on the database
- Close the connection when you are done

- When a Java application needs a database connection, one of the
DriverManager.getConnection() methods is used to create a JDBC
Connection.
- The URL used is dependent upon the particular database and JDBC
driver. It will always begin with the "jdbc:" protocol, but the rest is up
to the particular vendor.

Here is an example of how to connect to a database
import java.sql.*;
class dbConn {
    public static void main(String args[]) {
        try (Connection conn = DriverManager.getConnection(dbURL, dbname, password)) {
                /* you use the connection here */
        } 
    }
}
